<h1 align="center">Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>

In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic between Azure Virtual Machines using Wireshark and analyze how Network Security Groups (NSGs) impact that traffic. This lab demonstrates how protocols behave and how NSGs control traffic flow in a cloud environment.

<h2>üß∞ Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Ubuntu Terminal (SSH)
- Network Protocols: ICMP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, RDP, SSH
- Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)

---

<h2>üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 Pro (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS

---

<h2>üìã High-Level Steps</h2>

- Deploy two Virtual Machines in Azure (Windows and Linux)
- Install and configure Wireshark on the Windows VM
- Initiate traffic between the two VMs (ICMP, SSH, HTTP, DNS)
- Modify NSG rules and observe blocked/allowed traffic in real time

</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1: Deploy Azure Virtual Machines</strong><br />
Create a Windows 10 VM and an Ubuntu 20.04 VM in the same virtual network. Assign each VM a Network Security Group (NSG) and open the necessary ports (RDP for Windows, SSH for Linux, ICMP via custom rules).

</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 2: Capture Network Traffic</strong><br />
Install Wireshark on the Windows VM. Start a capture on the active network interface. From the Ubuntu VM, ping the Windows VM‚Äôs private IP and initiate connections (SSH, DNS, HTTP) to generate observable traffic in Wireshark.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 3: Experiment with NSG Rules</strong><br />
Using the Azure Portal, add or remove NSG rules to allow or block specific traffic types (e.g., deny ICMP or allow port 80). Observe how blocked packets appear in Wireshark (e.g., unreachable messages or dropped connections).

</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 4: Analyze Protocol Behavior</strong><br />
Filter captured packets in Wireshark using filters such as `icmp`, `tcp.port==22`, or `dns`. Examine packet headers, source/destination IPs, protocol handshakes, and analyze how traffic changes based on NSG configurations.
</p>

<h2>üí° Key Observations</h2>

- NSGs act as virtual firewalls at the subnet or NIC level.
- Denied traffic does not appear on the receiving VM but may generate ICMP unreachable responses.
- Wireshark helps visualize protocol behavior, packet size, and latency.
- ICMP, DNS, and HTTP are great for basic traffic tests; RDP and SSH help validate secure access controls.
